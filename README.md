## Exploiting GHSL-2023-005 for Amazon Trona.
This is a fork of security researcher Man Yue Mo's [Pixel 6 PoC](https://github.blog/2023-04-06-pwning-pixel-6-with-a-leftover-patch) for the Amazon Fire HD 10 2021. Changes are being made to account for `trona`'s older bifrost driver. Contributions are very welcome.
